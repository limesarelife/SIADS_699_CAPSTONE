Our ultimate objective is to develop a full-stack web app that includes a information retrieval with ranking recommender system capable of suggesting the Animal Crossing Villager that best matches the user's preferences, based on the options selected in the drop-down quiz. To reach our Minimum Viable Product (MVP), we would like to utilize several Python libraries, including Pandas, Numpy, and Sklearn for implementing cosine similarity. Our plan is to then use Django for front end-to- back end web development, connecting the website with the recommender system we create and utilizing the user's quiz responses. For web design, we'll use HTML and CSS, and we will create an Animal Crossing New Horizons aesthetic while leveraging the bootstrap framework for the frontend. In order to manage DNS and hosting, we will utilize various AWS products/services such as AWS Route 53 for DNS, an EC2 instance to host our code, and an S3 bucket to store the data. Or we may still use AWS Route 53 and host a static website via the s3 bucket. The data we will store in the S3 bucket will be from our Milestone 1 project and we'll feed this in to the recommender system. Our goal is to apply the skills we learned in our Cloud Computing elective and Machine Learning Pipelines class to achieve our ultimate objective of a fully deployed, end-to-end web application, inclusive of the recommender system, on AWS.
